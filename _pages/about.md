I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Department of Technology, Management and Economics. I received my PhD in Applied Economics and Management from Cornell University in 2024.

My research lies at the intersection of environmental economics and finance, with a focus on how climate and energy policies interact with firms’ financial decisions and real outcomes. I study the role of financing frictions, policy uncertainty, and firm heterogeneity in shaping the effectiveness of environmental regulation. By combining theoretical and empirical analysis, my work aims to inform the design of climate policies that are economically efficient and effective.
